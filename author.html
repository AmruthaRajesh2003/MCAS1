<p><i><b>This is the story of a cheerful little girl Binya, who lives with her mother and an elder brother Bijju, in the hills of Garhwal. One day, while herding her cows back home, she comes across some picnickers in the hills. They had a beautiful Blue Umbrella. Binya fell in love with the umbrella at first sight. In exchange for her lucky Leopard claw pendant, she acquires that umbrella.
This umbrella brings unbound happiness in Binya’s life, she carries it everywhere with her, and it becomes the talk of the town. This newfound fame brought with it jealousy and envy from some of the villagers. One old shopkeeper Rambharosa eyed this treasured possession of Binya and decided to own it by any means. He offers to buy the beautiful umbrella, which Binya refuses flatly, making him sad over his position. In the middle of the monsoon, he employs a boy Rajaram from the neighboring town, as a helper in his shop. Rajaram was a shrewd boy. After learning of Rambharosa’s fancy for the umbrella, he strikes a deal with him of getting him the umbrella to prove his worth. He then steals Binya’s blue umbrella and blames it on him (Rambharosa) to save his own skin after being caught by Bijju after a great fight. Everybody in the village believes him without any second thought, as they are all well aware of Rambharosa’s obsession with that umbrella. This brought an ill name to Rambharosa, and the villagers stopped buying from his shop. Seeing the poor shopkeeper’s plight, Binya empathized and decided to gift the umbrella to him. The little girl put Rambharosa’s happiness above her own and was ready to part with her most loved possession. In return, Rambharosa also showed kindness by first trying to return the umbrella and then gifting Binya the lucky bear claw pendant, hence proving that kindness will always attract kindness. Rambharosa told everyone that Binya had gifted him this umbrella. Villagers started to buy from his shop again.</center>
